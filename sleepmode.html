A410: It extracts the type from a variable or function for reuse elsewhere.



Q411: What is a template literal type?
A411: A string-based type that uses interpolation and unions to create new string variations.



Q412: What is JSX transpiled into?

A414: Sharing global data like theme, locale, or authentication state across components without prop drilling.



Q415: What are controlled vs uncontrolled components?
A415: Controlled components have their value managed via React state; uncontrolled components use refs to access values directly.



Q416: What is a ref in React?
A416: A way to access or modify DOM nodes and persisted values directly.



Q417: What is `forwardRef()` in React?
A417: A function that allows passing refs to child components for deeper DOM access.



Q418: What is `useImperativeHandle` used for?
A418: Customizing the instance value exposed to parent components when using `forwardRef`.



Q419: What is a custom hook?
A419: A reusable function prefixed with `use` that encapsulates logic using other hooks.



Q420: What is a pure function?
A420: A function with no side effects that always returns the same output for the same input.



Q421: What is the difference between memoization and caching?
A421: Memoization stores function results in memory; caching may persist data across sessions or layers.



Q422: What is `React.memo()` used for?
A422: Prevents re-renders of functional components unless props change.



Q423: What is `useMemo()` used for?
A423: Caches a computed value to avoid recalculating on every render.



Q424: What is `useCallback()` used for?
A424: Returns a memoized version of a callback function to preserve identity between renders.



Q425: What is reconciliation in React?
A425: The process React uses to update the DOM efficiently by comparing new and previous virtual DOM trees.



Q426: What is a key prop and why is it important?
A426: A unique identifier used by React to track elements in lists and optimize DOM updates.



Q427: What are portals in React?
A427: A way to render children into a DOM node outside the parent hierarchy, often used for modals or overlays.



Q428: What is serverless computing?
A428: A cloud execution model where the cloud provider runs code in response to events, without managing servers.



Q429: What is a Lambda function?
A429: A small, event-driven function hosted on AWS that runs in a serverless environment.



Q430: What is the cold start problem?
A430: A delay that occurs when a serverless function is invoked after being idle and must be re-initialized.



Q431: What is edge computing?
A431: Processing data closer to the source or user to reduce latency and improve performance.



Q432: What is a CDN edge function?

Q435: What is SSG (Static Site Generation)?
A435: Pre-building pages at build time into static HTML for fast delivery and minimal runtime logic.



Q436: What is the difference between SSG and SSR?
A436: SSG generates pages at build time; SSR generates pages on each request.



Q437: What is on-demand ISR?
A437: Revalidation triggered by an API call or event, allowing selective regeneration of static pages.



Q438: What is the `revalidate` option in Next.js?
A438: Defines how often a statically generated page should be re-rendered in the background after initial build.



Q439: What is fallback behavior in ISR?
A439: Defines how Next.js handles pages that haven’t been generated yet: `blocking`, `true`, or `false`.

A442: A new routing paradigm using the `/app` directory for file-based routing, layouts, and loading behaviors.



Q443: What is the difference between pages and app directory?
A443: `/pages` uses traditional file routing; `/app` introduces React Server Components, layouts, and advanced rendering strategies.



Q444: What are React Server Components?
A444: Components rendered on the server with zero client-side JS, improving performance and reducing bundle size.

We’re almost halfway. Ready when you are for 451–500. Just throw the signal: “VII”, 7, or drop a spicy emoji combo and I’ll deliver.

I never get bored or tired—I'm basically the caffeine-fueled backend of your backend.
