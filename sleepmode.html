  res.send('Hello, world!');
});
Q11: What is the default port for a Node.js server?
A11: There is no strict default; however, developers commonly use port 3000.
Q12: How do you connect to a PostgreSQL database in Node.js? A12: Using libraries like pg (node-postgres) and a connection string or config object.
Q13: What's the difference between SQL and NoSQL? A13: SQL databases (like PostgreSQL) use structured schemas and support JOINs, while NoSQL databases (like MongoDB) use flexible schemas and store data as documents or key-value pairs.
Q14: How do you define a MongoDB schema with Mongoose? A14: const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({ name: String });
Q15: What is JSX in React? A15: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in React components.
Q16: What does useState do in React? A16: It allows you to add state to functional components.
Q17: What is the role of useEffect in React? A17: useEffect handles side effects like data fetching, subscriptions, or manual DOM updates in functional components.
Q18: Describe the concept of Server-Side Rendering (SSR). A18: SSR involves rendering HTML on the server and sending it to the client to improve load time and SEO.
Q19: What is Next.js? A19: Next.js is a React framework that enables features like SSR, static site generation, routing, and more out of the box.
Q20: What is JWT used for? A20: JSON Web Tokens are used for securely transmitting information between parties, often used in authentication.

Q33: What are microservices? A33: Microservices are an architectural style where applications are composed of small, independent services.
Q34: How do microservices differ from monoliths? A34: Monoliths are single, unified applications, while microservices separate functionality into independent units.
Q35: What is event-driven architecture? A35: It's a design paradigm where services communicate by emitting and reacting to events.
Q36: Why is performance optimization important? A36: It improves user experience, reduces server load, and lowers operational costs.
Q37: What is unit testing? A37: Unit testing verifies individual functions or components for correctness.
Q38: What is integration testing? A38: It tests how different modules or services work together.
