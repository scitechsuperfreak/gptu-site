    Q1: What are the main differences between HTML and JavaScript? A1: HTML is a markup language used for structuring content on the web, while JavaScript is a programming language used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.
    Q2: What does CSS3 add to CSS2? A2: CSS3 introduces features like media queries, flexbox, grid layout, transitions, animations, and additional selectors for enhanced styling.
    Q3: Explain the role of the DOM in JavaScript. A3: The DOM (Document Object Model) is an interface that represents the structure of an HTML document as a tree, allowing JavaScript to access and manipulate elements dynamically.
    Q9: What is Express.js? A9: Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides robust features for building APIs and web apps.
    Q54: What is middleware in Express.js? A54: Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request, response, and next middleware in the pipeline.
    Q107: What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript? A107: Synchronous code runs sequentially; asynchronous code allows tasks like I/O to run in the background, often using promises or async/await.
    Q111: What is an HOC in React? A111: Higher-Order Component – a function that takes a component and returns an enhanced component.
    Q112: What is SSR caching and why is it useful? A112: It stores rendered pages to serve repeated requests quickly, reducing server load and improving performance.
    Q115: What is the difference between client-side and server-side rendering? A115: Client-side rendering builds UI in the browser; server-side rendering sends fully formed HTML from the server.
    Q116: How does React Router differ from Next.js routing? A116: React Router uses a manual route config, while Next.js uses file-based routing.
    Q117: What is optimistic UI? A117: A UX technique where the UI updates immediately after an action is taken, before receiving confirmation from the server.
    Q118: What is the difference between PUT and PATCH in REST? A118: PUT replaces an entire resource; PATCH modifies only specified fields.
    Q119: What is HTTP status code 201? A119: Created – indicates successful creation of a resource.
    Q120: What is HTTP status code 204? A120: No Content – successful request with no body in the response.
    Q121: What is HTTP status code 401? A121: Unauthorized – indicates the user must authenticate.
    Q122: What is HTTP status code 403? A122: Forbidden – authentication succeeded, but the user lacks permission.
    Q123: What is HTTP status code 500? A123: Internal Server Error – indicates something went wrong on the server.

    Q127: What is a memory leak? A127: Unused memory that is not released, leading to increased memory usage and potential app crashes.
    Q131: What is a closure in JavaScript? A131: A closure is a function that retains access to its lexical scope even when executed outside its scope.
    Q132: What is event bubbling? A132: The process where events propagate from the target element up to the root in the DOM tree.
    Q133: What is debouncing? A133: A technique to limit how often a function executes, commonly used in input and resize events.

    Q157: What is a cookie? A157: A small piece of data stored in the browser, often used for session tracking and authentication.
    Q158: How is a token-based auth flow different from cookie-based? A158: Token-based auth stores credentials in client-side memory or storage; cookie-based uses HTTP-only cookies sent with every request.
    Q159: What is the Same-Origin Policy? A159: A browser security feature that restricts interactions between documents from different origins.
    Q160: What is a CSRF attack? A160: Cross-Site Request Forgery tricks a user into submitting a request they didn’t intend, using their credentials.
    Q161: What is the solution to CSRF in modern web apps? A161: Using CSRF tokens in forms, SameSite cookie policies, or token-based authentication methods like JWT.

    Q168: What is eventual consistency useful for? A168: High-availability distributed systems where real-time accuracy is less important than uptime and performance.
    Q169: What’s the difference between NoSQL document stores and key-value stores? A169: Document stores (e.g., MongoDB) store structured JSON-like docs; key-value stores (e.g., Redis) store simple key-value pairs.
    Q170: What is Redis commonly used for? A170: Caching, session storage, pub/sub messaging, and real-time analytics due to its speed.
    Q171: What is a CDN? A171: A Content Delivery Network stores cached versions of content across various geographical servers to reduce latency.
    Q172: How do you invalidate a cache? A172: You clear or mark cached data as expired, prompting the system to fetch fresh content.
    Q176: What is a merge conflict? A176: When Git cannot automatically resolve differences between branches and requires manual intervention.
    Q177: What is semantic versioning? A177: A versioning system using MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH to indicate breaking changes, new features, and fixes.

    Q193: What is the difference between development and production builds? A193: Dev builds include debugging tools and logs; prod builds are optimized and minified.
    Q197: What is a dependency graph? A197: A visual or structural representation of how modules or packages depend on each other.
    Q201: What is a peer dependency in npm? A201: A dependency that a package requires to function, but expects the host project to provide.

    Q209: What is salting in password hashing? A209: Adding random data to passwords before hashing to prevent rainbow table attacks.
    Q210: What is the difference between hashing and encryption? A210: Hashing is one-way and irreversible; encryption is two-way and can be decrypted with a key.
    Q211: What is the purpose of HTTPS? A211: To encrypt data in transit, ensuring confidentiality and integrity between client and server.
    Q212: What is HSTS? A212: HTTP Strict Transport Security forces browsers to only use HTTPS with a site.
    Q213: What is a digital certificate? A213: A file issued by a Certificate Authority (CA) that proves the authenticity of a site over HTTPS.
    Q214: What is the difference between PUT and POST? A214: PUT is idempotent and updates or creates a resource at a known URI; POST is non-idempotent and creates a new resource.

    Q221: What is the difference between scaling vertically and horizontally? A221: Vertical scaling adds more power to a single server; horizontal adds more servers to distribute load.
    Q222: What is a service registry in microservices? A222: A centralized database that tracks available services and their locations.

    Q226: What is circuit breaking in microservices? A226: A pattern that stops attempts to contact a failing service to prevent cascading failures.
    Q227: What does the 503 status code mean? A227: Service Unavailable – the server is not ready to handle the request.
    Q228: What is a container orchestration tool? A228: A platform for managing containers at scale, such as Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.
    Q229: What is a pod in Kubernetes? A229: The smallest deployable unit, which can contain one or more containers.
    Q230: What is a health check in containerized environments? A230: A method to determine if an application is running correctly; can trigger restarts or traffic redirection.
    Q231: What is CI vs CD? A231: CI (Continuous Integration) automates testing and building; CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment) automates release to staging or production.
    Q232: What is a blue-green deployment? A232: A release strategy where two environments (blue and green) are used, allowing instant rollback.
    Q233: What is a canary release? A233: A deployment strategy where new code is gradually released to a small subset of users before full rollout.

    Q246: What is a permissions matrix? A246: A table defining which roles can perform which actions on which resources.
    Q247: What is the difference between authentication and authorization? A247: Authentication verifies identity; authorization checks permissions.

    Q249: What is rate limiting? A249: Restricting the number of requests a user or system can make to a server in a given time frame.
    Q251: What is an index in a database? A251: A data structure that improves the speed of queries at the cost of additional space and slower writes.
    Q252: What is the difference between a clustered and non-clustered index? A252: A clustered index sorts the actual data rows; a non-clustered index stores pointers to the data.
    Q253: What is a composite index? A253: An index on multiple columns used to optimize queries filtering by all or part of those columns.
    Q254: What is a foreign key? A254: A constraint that creates a relationship between two tables by linking a column to the primary key of another.
