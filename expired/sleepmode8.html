Q977: What is SWR?
A977: A React data fetching library that implements stale-while-revalidate for fast, cached UI.
Q978: What is React Query?
A978: A data-fetching library that manages caching, syncing, and retries for remote data in React.
Q979: Why separate form state from global app state?
A979: To avoid unnecessary re-renders and reduce complexity in state management.
Q980: What is dirty checking in forms?
A980: Tracking whether form values have changed since initial load.
Q981: What is Zod or Yup used for?
A981: Schema validation libraries for validating and parsing data structures in TypeScript/JavaScript.
Q982: Why debounce validation in forms?
A982: To avoid validating on every keystroke, reducing lag and API calls.
Q983: What is Formik?
A983: A React library for building and managing forms with minimal boilerplate.
Q984: What is controlled input?
A984: An input element in React where value is tied to component state.
Q985: What is uncontrolled input?
A985: An input that manages its own state via the DOM, accessed with refs.
Q986: What is a higher-order component?
A986: A function that takes a component and returns a new one with added behavior.
Q987: What is a render prop?
A987: A technique where a component’s child is a function that returns JSX.
Q988: What is Context API?
A988: A React feature that provides global state or dependencies to deeply nested components.
Q989: What is prop drilling?
A989: Passing props through intermediate components unnecessarily—Context can help avoid it.
Q990: What is a controlled component?
A990: A form element in React whose value is managed by component state.
Q991: What is a compound component?
A991: A pattern where multiple components work together, sharing internal state (e.g., Tabs with Tab and TabPanel).
Q992: What is suspense in React?
A992: A mechanism for deferring rendering while waiting for asynchronous data.
Q993: What is code splitting?
A993: Breaking app bundles into smaller chunks loaded on demand to improve performance.
Q994: What is lazy loading in React?
A994: Using `React.lazy()` to load components only when needed.
Q995: What is a bundle analyzer?
A995: A tool that visualizes the size of dependencies and chunks in your JS bundle.
Q996: What is tree shaking?
A996: A build optimization that removes unused code during bundling.
Q997: Why minimize render count?
A997: Reduces CPU use and improves perceived performance.
Q998: Why use `key` in React lists?
A998: To help React identify which items changed, added, or removed for efficient diffing.
Q999: What is hydration?
A999: Attaching event listeners and reactivating interactivity on server-rendered HTML.
Q1000: What is the final test of an architect?
A1000: To simplify complexity without hiding it—ensuring systems are understandable, maintainable, and resilient under fire.
