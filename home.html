    <h1>Welcome to GPTU</h1>
    <p>This is the Manifesto page. The future of education is modular, agentic, and bluntly practical.</p>
    <p><strong>AI is not our adversary.</strong> Artificial Intelligence is a neutral instrument—comparable to the hammer—whose ethical valence depends entirely upon human intent and application. As with any powerful tool, it possesses the dual capacity to construct or to destroy. The central issue lies not in AI’s existence, but in the inequity of its distribution. When access to such potent systems is concentrated, corruption becomes inevitable, echoing Lord Acton’s principle: "Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely." That is why one of GPTU’s core missions is <em>Artificial Intelligence For All</em>—the democratization of AI as a distributed, collective utility rather than a monopolized force.</p>
